Thank you for your interest in this educational project! ??

## ?? Project Purpose

This is primarily an **academic project** designed to teach Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++. While contributions are welcome, please keep the educational nature of the project in mind.

## ?? How to Contribute

### For Students

If you're using this for learning:

1. **Fork the repository** to your account
2. **Study the code thoroughly** - understand every concept
3. **Make it your own** - add unique features
4. **Share your improvements** - submit a pull request with educational enhancements

### For Educators

If you're an educator who wants to use or improve this:

1. Feel free to use this as teaching material
2. Suggest improvements that enhance learning
3. Share additional documentation or explanations
4. Propose new features that demonstrate OOP concepts

### For Developers

If you're a developer who wants to contribute:

1. Ensure changes maintain code simplicity for learning
2. Add clear comments explaining new concepts
3. Update documentation to reflect changes
4. Write examples for new features

## ?? Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and simple
- Maintain const correctness

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add comments explaining OOP concepts
- Update relevant documentation files
- Provide examples for new functionality

### What We're Looking For

? **Good Contributions:**
- Bug fixes
- Improved documentation
- Better error handling
- Additional OOP demonstrations
- Performance improvements (while keeping code simple)
- Cross-platform compatibility fixes
- Enhanced user interface/output
- Additional movie genres or categories
- More search/filter options

? **Not Suitable:**
- Over-complicated features that obscure learning
- Breaking changes that remove OOP demonstrations
- Removing documentation or comments
- Changes that make code harder to understand

## ?? Submission Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** with clear commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Description of what you added"
   ```
4. **Test thoroughly** - ensure code compiles and runs
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. **Submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Why the change improves the project
   - Any new concepts demonstrated
   - Testing performed

## ?? Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a suggestion?

1. **Check existing issues** first
2. **Create a new issue** with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, compiler, etc.)
   - Suggestions for improvement

## ?? Feature Requests

Have an idea for improvement?

1. **Ensure it fits** the educational purpose
2. **Explain the learning value** - what OOP concept does it demonstrate?
3. **Describe the feature** clearly
4. **Consider implementation complexity** - should remain accessible to students

## ?? Suggested Improvements

Ideas for contributions:

### Beginner-Friendly
- Add more input validation
- Improve error messages
- Add more movie data
- Create additional search filters
- Enhance output formatting
- Add color to console output

### Intermediate
- Implement sorting algorithms
- Add file I/O for saving/loading movies
- Create a menu-driven interface
- Add movie genres as a new attribute
- Implement binary search (after sorting)
- Add director and cast information

### Advanced
- Demonstrate inheritance (Media ? Movie, TVShow)
- Add polymorphism examples
- Implement operator overloading
- Create custom exceptions
- Add template functions
- Demonstrate design patterns

## ?? Learning Resources

When contributing, consider these OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Keep data private, provide public interface
- **Abstraction**: Hide complexity, show only necessary details
- **Inheritance**: Create hierarchies (for advanced contributions)
- **Polymorphism**: Multiple forms of same interface (advanced)

## ? Code Review Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Program runs correctly
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New features are documented
- [ ] Comments explain OOP concepts
- [ ] Consistent code style
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] README updated if needed

## ?? Acknowledgments

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- README.md contributors section
- Project documentation
- Release notes (for significant contributions)

## ?? Questions?

- Open an issue for technical questions
- Check documentation files first
- Review existing issues and PRs

## ?? Thank You!

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps make this a better educational resource. Thank you for being part of this learning community!
