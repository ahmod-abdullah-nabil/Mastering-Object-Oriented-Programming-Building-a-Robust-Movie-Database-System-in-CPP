BEFORE SUBMISSION:
  ? Run the program and verify it works
  ? Read through all the code to understand it
  ? Review the documentation files
  ? Practice explaining the OOP concepts
  ? Prepare for potential questions

DURING PRESENTATION:
  ? Show confidence - you built something impressive!
  ? Demonstrate the running program first
  ? Explain the code structure clearly
  ? Highlight the OOP concepts
  ? Be ready to answer "why" questions

COMMON QUESTIONS TO PREPARE FOR:
  
  Q: "Why did you choose these specific movies?"
  A: "I selected critically acclaimed films from diverse languages and eras
      to demonstrate the system's flexibility and to showcase my knowledge
      of cinema. The collection includes Oscar winners and international
      classics from 1967 to 2024."

  Q: "Explain encapsulation in your project."
  A: "In my Movie class, all data members are private. Users cannot directly
      access or modify them. Instead, they must use getter and setter methods,
      which provide controlled access and data validation. For example, the
      setRating method ensures ratings stay within 1-5 range."

  Q: "How does your top-rated movie algorithm work?"
  A: "I use a two-pass linear search. First pass finds the maximum rating
      by looping through all movies. Second pass displays all movies with
      that maximum rating. It's O(n) time complexity, efficient for our
      dataset size."

  Q: "What would you improve if you had more time?"
  A: "I would consider using std::vector for dynamic sizing, add file I/O
      to save/load movies, implement sorting by different criteria, and
      possibly add inheritance with a base Media class."
